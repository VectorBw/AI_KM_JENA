            <p>The <em>Semantic Web is a Web of data</em>. There is a lot of data we all use every day, and it's not part of the Web. For example, I can see my bank statements on the web, and my photographs, and I can see my appointments in a calendar. But can I see my photos in a calendar to see what I was doing when I took them? Can I see bank statement lines in a calendar? Why not? Because we don't have a web of data. Because data is controlled by applications, and each application keeps it to itself.
				</p>
			
			  
            <p>
				The vision of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data. Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s; data should be related to one another just as documents (or portions of documents) are already. This also means creation of a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries, to be processed automatically by tools as well as manually, including revealing possible new relationships among pieces of data. 
			  </p>
			  	
			  
            <p>
				Semantic Web technologies can be used in a variety of application areas; for example:
				in <em>data integration</em>, whereby data in various locations and various formats can
				be integrated in one, seamless application; in <em>resource discovery and
				classification</em> to provide better, domain specific search engine capabilities; in
				<em>cataloging</em> for describing the content and content relationships available at a
				particular Web site, page, or digital library; by <em>intelligent software agents</em>
				to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange; in <em>content rating</em>; in describing
				<em>collections</em> of pages that represent a single logical “document”; for
				describing <em>intellectual property rights</em> of Web pages (see, eg, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/usingmarkup" shape="rect">Creative Commons</a>), and in many
				others.

				No <em>formal</em> definitions, but of course there are different approaches. Indeed, the complexity and variety of applications referring to the Semantic Web is increasing every day, which means that various application areas, implementers, developers, etc, would emphasize different aspects of Semantic Web technologies. This wide range of applications include data integration, knowledge representation and analysis, cataloguing services, improving search algorithms and methods, social networks, etc.

				In order to achieve the goals <a href="#swgoals" shape="rect">described above</a>, the most
				important is to be able to define and describe the relations among data (i.e.,
				resources) on the Web. This is not unlike the usage of hyperlinks on the current Web
				that connect the current page with another one: the hyperlinks defines a relationship
				between the current page and the target. One major difference is that, on the Semantic
				Web, such relationships can be established between <em>any</em> two resources, there is
				no notion of “current” page. Another major difference is that the relationship
				(i.e, the link) itself is <em>named</em>, whereas the link used by a human on the
				(traditional) Web is not and their role is deduced by the human reader. The definition
				of those relations allow for a better and automatic interchange of data. <a href="#whrdf" shape="rect">RDF</a>, which is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Semantic Web,
				gives a formal definition for that interchange.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				On that basis, additional building blocks are built around this central notion. Some
				examples are:
			  </p>
			  
            <ul>
				
               <li>Tools to query information described through such relationships (eg, SPARQL)
				</li>
				
               <li>Tools to have a finer and more detailed classification and characterization of
				those relationships as well as the resources being characterized. This ensures interoperability,
				more complex automatic behaviors. For example, a community can agree what name to use for a relationship
				connecting a page to one’s calendar; this name can then be used by a large number of
				users and applications without the necessity to redefine such names every time. 
				(E.g., RDF Schemas, OWL, SKOS)
				</li>
				
               <li>For more complex cases, tools are available to define logical relationships among
				resources and their relationships (for example, if a relationships binds a person to
				his/her email address, it is feasible to declare that the email address is unique, ie,
				the address is not shared by several persons). Tools based on this level (e.g., OWL, Rules) can ensure
				more interoperability, can reveal inconsistencies and find new relationships. 
				</li>
				
               <li>Tools to extract from, and to bind to traditional data sources to ensure their
				interchange with data from other sources. (E.g., GRDDL, RDFa)
				</li>
			  
            </ul>

				It is difficult to predict what a “killer application” is for a specific
				technology, and the prediction is often erroneous. That said, the integration of
				currently unbound and independent “silos” of data in a coherent application is
				certainly a good candidate. Specific examples are currently explored in areas like
				<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SemanticWebForLifeSciences" shape="rect">Health Care and Life
				Sciences</a>, <a href="http://www.swed.org.uk" shape="rect">Public Administration</a>, <a href="http://www.swop-project.eu/" shape="rect">Engineering</a>, etc.

				Not necessarily, at least not directly. The Semantic Web technologies may act behind
				the scenes, resulting in a better user experience, rather than directly influencing the
				“look” on the browser. This is already happening: there are Web Sites (e.g.,
				Sun’s <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/wp.html/" shape="rect">white paper collection site</a>,
				or Nokia’s <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/" shape="rect">support portal for their S60 series

				<a href="http://www.harpers.org/" shape="rect">Harper’s online magazine</a>, or

				As all innovative technologies, the Semantic Web underwent an evolution starting at
				research labs, being then picked up by the Open Source community, then by small and
				specialized startups and finally by business in general. Remember: the Web was
				originally developed in a High Energy Physics center!
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				At present, the Semantic Web is increasingly used by small and large business. <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/semantic_technologies/index.html" shape="rect">Oracle</a>,
				<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/semanticstk" shape="rect">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/index.html" shape="rect">Adobe</a>, <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/news/pressroom/pressreleases/20050309_enterprise_information_integration_page.asp" shape="rect">
				Software AG</a>, or <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" shape="rect">Yahoo!</a> are only some of the large corporations that have picked up this technology
				already and are selling tools as well as complete business solutions. Large application
				areas, like the <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SemanticWebForLifeSciences" shape="rect">Health
				Care and Life Sciences</a>, look at the data integration possibilities of the Semantic
				Web as one of the technologies that might offer significant help in solving their
				R&amp;D problems.

            <p>
				First of all, <a href="#whmustont" shape="rect">as pointed out elsewhere in this document</a>, one
				can develop Semantic Web applications without using ontologies. Very useful
				applications can be built without those, relying on the most fundamental, and simple
				concept of the Semantic Web. However, even if ontologies, rules, reasoners, etc, are
				used, the average user should not care about the complexities of, say, the details of
				reasoning. All this is done “under the hood”. What the developer needs to operate
				with are usually simple logical patterns of the sort “Given that
				<code>(Flipper isA Dolphin)</code> and <code>(Dolphin isAlso Mammal)</code>, one
				can conclude that <code>(Flipper isA Mammal)</code>".
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				Compare it to SQL. The official SQL standards, the formal semantics of SQL, and indeed
				its implementations, are extremely complex and understood by a few specialists only.
				Nevertheless, a large number of users use SQL in practice, without caring about the
				underlying complexities.

				The Semantic Web is an <em>extension</em> of the current Web and not its replacement.
				Islands of RDF and possibly related ontologies can be developed incrementally. Major
				application areas (like Health Care and Life Sciences) may choose to “locally”
				adopt Semantic Web technologies, and this can then spread over the Web in general. In
				other words, one should not think in terms of “rebuilding” the Web.

				Both formalisms have their strengths and weaknesses; their area of usage is different.
				The two data models serve different constituencies and the choice really depends on the
				application. There is no better or worse; only different.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				One of XML’s strengths is its ability to describe strict hierarchies. Applications
				may rely on and indeed exploit the position of an element in a hierarchy: for example,
				most browsers provide a different rendering of HTML’s <code>li</code> element
				depending on how “deep” the enclosing list is. XML makes it easy to control the
				content via XML Schemas and combine XML data that abide to the same Schema or DTD.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				However, combining <em>different</em> XML hierarchies (technically, DOM trees) within
				the same application may become very complex. XML is not an easy tool for <em>data
				integration</em>. On the other hand, RDF consists of a very loose set of relations
				(triples). Due to its <a href="#weburi" shape="rect">usage of URIs</a> it is very easy to seamlessly
				merge triple sets, ie, data described in RDF within the same application; it is
				therefore ideal for the integration of possibly heterogenous information on the Web.
				But this has its price: reconstructing hierarchies from RDF may become quite complex.
				As an example, it would be fairly complicated (and unnecessary) to describe, eg, vector
				graphics, using RDF; use <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/" shape="rect">SVG</a> instead!
			  </p>
			  
            <p>For existing XML-based vocabularies, one can develop an
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-primer/" shape="rect">GRDDL transformation</a> to RDF
				using a language such as XSLT and then use the power of RDF to merge
				your pre-existing XML formats. For new vocabularies, this technique	
				allows you to use both XML and RDF-based versions of your vocabulary,
				gaining the advantages of both.

            <p>
				This issue is also related to the issue of using XML or RDF, addressed in a <a href="#relXML" shape="rect">previous question</a>. First of all, let us quote from the <a href="/TR/owl-guide/" shape="rect">OWL Guide recommendation</a>:
			  </p>
			  
            <blockquote>
				
               <ul>
				  
                  <li>An ontology differs from an XML Schema in that it is a knowledge representation,
				  not a message format. Most industry based Web standards consist of a combination of
				  message formats and protocol specifications. These formats have been given an
				  operational semantics, such as, “Upon receipt of this <code>PurchaseOrder</code>
				  message, transfer <code>Amount</code> dollars from <code>AccountFrom</code> to <code>
					AccountTo</code> and ship <code>Product</code>.” But the specification is not
					designed to support reasoning outside the transaction context. For example, we
					won’t in general have a mechanism to conclude that because the
					<code>Product</code> is a type of <code>Chardonnay</code> it must also be a white
					wine.
				  </li>
				  
                  <li>One advantage of OWL ontologies will be the availability of tools that can reason
				  about them. Tools will provide generic support that is not specific to the particular
				  subject domain, which would be the case if one were to build a system to reason about
				  a specific industry-standard XML schema. […] They will benefit from third party
				  tools based on the formal properties of the OWL language, tools that will deliver an
				  assortment of capabilities that most organizations would be hard pressed to
				  duplicate.
				  </li>
				
               </ul>
			  
            </blockquote>
			  
            <p>
				Also, XML data is very sensitive to the XML Schema it refers to. If the XML Schema
				changes, the <em>same</em> XML data may become invalid, i.e., being rejected by
				Schema-aware parsers. Somewhat similar dependence on RDF Schemas and Ontologies exist
				for RDF data, too: if the RDF Schema or OWL Ontology changes, the inferences drawn from
				the RDF data may change. However, the core RDF data is still usable, there is no notion
				of the data being “rejected” by, e.g., a parser due to a Schema/Ontology change. In
				general, RDF is more robust against changing of Schemas and Ontologies than XML is
				versus Schemas. Note that a GRDDL transformation from XML to RDF may be given by an XML Schema as
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/#ns-bind" shape="rect">described in the GRDDL
				specification</a>. This allows any XML document that validates according
				to the XML Schema given at the namespace URI of the XML vocabulary to be
				converted to RDF.

				The <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> elements in HTML can be used to add
				metadata to an HTML page. In Semantic Web terms, this is equivalent to the process of
				defining RDF relationships for that page as a “source”. Note, however, that these
				elements can be used to define relationships for the enclosing HTML file only, whereas
				the Semantic Web allows the definition of relationships on <em>any</em> resource on the
				Web. That also means that the <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> elements can be
				used <em>by the author of the document only</em>, whereas, on the Semantic Web, anybody
				could publish metadata concerning that page. GRDDL allows easy and automatic extraction of meta header
				data, such as that given by Dublin Core, to RDF.

				Tagging has emerged as a popular method of categorizing content. Users are allowed to
				attach arbitrary strings to their data items (for example, blog entries and
				photographs). 
				While tagging is easy and useful, it often discards a lot of
				the semantics of the data. A folksonomy tag is typically 2/3 of an RDF
				triple. The subject is known: e.g., the URL for the flickr image being
				tagged, or the URL being bookmarked in delicious. The object is known:
				e.g.,  <code>http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cats</code> or
				<code>http://del.icio.us/tag/cats</code>. But the predicate to connect them is
				often missing. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/" shape="rect">Machine-tags</a>
				lend themselves to RDF more since they better capture the relationship between the subject 
				and the object. Folksonomy providers are encouraged to capture or infer the semantics
				around their tags and to leverage semantic web technologies such as
				RDF and SKOS to publish machine readable versions of their concept
				schemes.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>Another issue arising with tags is that the number of different tags meaning the same things but differing in spelling, lower or upper case, usage of space or underscore characters etc., may create major obstacles to them being used on a larger scale. There are a number of initiatives, start-up companies, projects, etc., that aim at combining the two approaches, providing a little bit of extra rigour using Semantic Web techniques to create new type of applications (<a shape="rect" hreflang="http://www.opencalais.com/">Reuters’ Open Calais service</a>, <a shape="rect" hreflang="http://www.twine.com">Radar Networks’ Twine</a>, the <a href="http://moat-project.org/" shape="rect">MOAT initiative</a>, <a href="http://tagcommons.org/" shape="rect">Tag Commons</a>, etc.).</p>

				Microformats are usually relatively small and simple sets of terms agreed upon by a
				community. Data models developed within the framework of the Semantic Web have the
				potential to be more expressive, rigorous, and formal (and are usually larger). Both
				can be used to express structured data within web pages. In some cases, microformats
				are appropriate because the extra features provided by Semantic Web technologies are
				not necessary. Other cases requiring more rigor will not be able to use microformats.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				Data described in microformats each address a <em>specific</em> problem area. One has
				to develop a program well-adapted to a particular microformat, to the way it uses, say,
				the class and property="dc:date" content attributes. It also becomes difficult (though possible) to combine
				different microformats. In contrast, RDF can represent <em>any</em>
				information—including that extracted from microformats present on the page. This is
				where microformats can benefit from RDF—the generality of the Semantic Web tools
				makes it easier to reuse existing tools, eg, a query language and combining statements
				from different origins easily belongs to the very essence of the Semantic Web.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				
               <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/grddl-wg/" shape="rect">GRDDL</a> is a “bridge” to the
				microformats approach; it defines a general procedure whereby
				microformats stored in an XHTML file can be transformed into RDF
				on–the–fly. A list of microformat to RDF vocabulary can be found on
				<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/CustomRdfDialects" shape="rect">on the ESW Wiki</a>. 
				Another technology is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax" shape="rect">RDFa</a> that defines an XHTML1.1 module that gives the possibility to use virtually any RDF vocabulary as annotations of the XHTML
				content; a bit like microformats with somewhat more rigor and a better way of
				<em>integrating</em> different vocabularies within the same document. Finally, <a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml" shape="rect">eRDF</a> (developed by Talis)
				offers a formalism somewhere between the two: one can add general RDF data to an
				(X)HTML page without the need for a new module, although with restrictions on the type
				of RDF vocabularies that can be used.

				One aspect of Web 2.0, beyond the exciting new interfaces and the usage of a common intelligence, is that it pushes
				intelligence and active agents from the server to the client, more specifically the
				browser. Development of active client-side application also means that these
				applications use all kinds of <strong>data</strong>; data that are on the Web
				somewhere, or data that is embedded in the page though not necessarily visible on the
				screen. Examples are microformats type annotation of the page, calendar data on the
				Web, tagged images or links stored on a web site, etc. This aspect of Web 2.0, ie, that
				applications are based on <em>combining</em> various types of data (“mashing up”
				the data) that are spread all around on the Web coincides with the very essence of the
				Semantic Web. What the Semantic Web provides is a more consistent model and tools for
				the definition and the usage of qualified relationships among data on the Web. I.e.,
				both technologies focus on intelligent data sharing. A number of typical Web 2.0
				demonstrations and applications emerge that, in the background, use Semantic Web tools
				combined with AJAX and other, exciting user interface approaches.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				In many cases, using RDF-based techniques makes the mashing up process easier, mainly
				when data collected by one application is reused by another one somewhere down the
				line. The general nature of RDF makes this “mashup chaining” straightforward, which
				is not always the case for simpler Web 2.0 applications.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>Trying to present these two approaches as alternatives, or even claiming folksonomies to be superior to the Semantic Web approach, has been a topic of the blogosphere and various publications for a while, but both communities realize these days that these two techniques are complementary rather than competitive. </p>

				The Semantic Web is about a web of data. The data itself can reside in databases,
				spreadsheets, Wiki pages, or indeed traditional web pages.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				The challenge is to develop tools that can “export” these data into RDF form: RDF
				plays the role of a common model, as a kind of a “glue” to integrate the data. That
				does <em>not</em> mean that the data must be <em>physically converted</em> into RDF
				form and stored in, say, RDF/XML. Instead, automatic procedures, for example <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfAndSql" shape="rect">SQL to RDF converters</a> for relational databases,
				<a href="grddl-wg/" shape="rect">GRDDL</a> processors for XHTML files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformats" shape="rect">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax" shape="rect">RDFa</a>, etc, can produce RDF data
				on-the-fly as an answer to, eg, queries. RDF data may also be included in the data via
				other tools (e.g, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/index.html" shape="rect">Adobe’s
				XMP</a> data that gets automatically added to JPEG images by Photoshop). Authoring
				tools also exist to develop, eg, ontologies on a high level instead of editing the
				ontology files directly. Of course, direct editing of RDF data is sometimes necessary,
				but it can be expected to become less and less prevalent as smarter editors come to the
				fore.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				Clearly, lots of development is still to be done in this area, and it is a subject of
				active Research and Development. The goal is to reuse, as much as possible,
				<em>existing</em> data in its <em>existing</em> form, and minimize the RDF data that
				has to be created manually.

				The Semantic Web provides an application framework that <em>extends</em> the current
				Web, does not replace it. That also means that the current infrastructure of firewalls,
				various levels of protections, encryption, etc, remain in place. If, for whatever
				reason (privacy, business, etc), the data should be kept behind the firewall on the
				Intranet, rather than being in the open, this just means that that particular Semantic
				Web application operates on the Intranet. This is not unlike the development of the
				traditional Web, the usage of Web Services, etc: a number of applications were
				developed to be used behind corporate firewalls; some of them migrated later to the
				full Web, some other stayed behind the firewall. The same is valid for Semantic Web
				applications.

				There are several lists on the Web that give a more-or-less comprehensive overview of

				In general most of the tools are of a good quality already. On the open source domain
				<a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net" shape="rect">Jena</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sesame/" shape="rect">Sesame</a>, or <a href="http://librdf.org/" shape="rect">Redland</a>, for example, can easily be compared to xerces in
				their widespread usage and richness of features; databases like <a href="http://mulgara.org/" shape="rect">Mulgara</a> or <a href="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/" shape="rect">Virtuoso</a> are 
				also in widespread use and have undergone a very thorough development in the past few years. There are more and more commercial tools, including editors, professional databases, content management
				systems, ontology creation and validation tools, etc. The <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SemanticWebTools" shape="rect">Wiki page</a> on the W3C ESW Wiki site gives
				a good overview of most of those.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				Obviously, there is room for improvement. SW is a younger technology than XML and it
				still needs time to catch up and have tools of the same maturity and efficiency level
				than the XML World. However, huge improvements have already been made in the past few
				years in all areas, and large-scale enterprise deployment is also happening already. In
				general: availability of tools is not a reason any more for not developing Semantic Web
				applications…

				Until recently, it was not possible to incorporate full RDF into XHTML without
				violating the validity of the resulting XHTML, except for the usage of the
				<code>meta</code> and the <code>link</code> elements in the header.
				The best solution was to store the RDF separately and use the URIs to refer to the XHTML
				page and the <code>link</code> element in the XHTML page to refer to the RDF content.
				This technique is often called an RDF autodiscovery link and is used by a number of
				tools already.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>However, this has changed with the newer developements of GRDDL and of RDFa. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-primer/" shape="rect">GRDDL</a> provides a “bridge” to the
				microformats approach while <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/" shape="rect">RDFa</a> provides an XHTML1.1 module that gives the possibility to use virtually any RDF vocabulary as annotations
				of the XHTML content, yielding RDF data.</p>

				This is one of the active areas of R&amp;D, and no final answer is yet available. In
				general, methods exist to convert RDF queries (e.g., in SPARQL) into SQL queries
				on-the-fly; ie, the RDB looks like an RDF store when queried by an RDF tool. The
				details of the mapping from Relational Tables to RDF notions is usually described for a
				specific database using either a small ontology and/or a set of rules; this is the only
				manual information to be generated for the conversion. General solutions begin to
				emerge, but work still has to be done (and is part of the future plans of W3C). See the
				<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfAndSql" shape="rect">W3C Wiki page</a> for further details.

				RDF—the <a href="/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" shape="rect">Resource Description Framework</a>—is a
				standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data
				merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the
				evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship
				between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a
				“triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data
				to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				This linking structure forms a directed, labelled graph, where the edges represent the
				named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This <em>graph
				view</em> is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in
				easy-to-understand visual explanations.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/" shape="rect">“RDF Primer”</a> is a good material
				for further reading on RDF.

				RDF statements (or triples) can be encoded in a number of different formats, whether
				XML based (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/" shape="rect">RDF/XML</a>) or not
				(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/" shape="rect">Turtle</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples" shape="rect">N-triples</a>, …). In general it does
				not really matter which of these formats (or serializations) are used to express
				data—the information is represented in RDF triples and the particular format is only
				the “syntactic sugar”. Most RDF tools can parse several of these serialization
				formats.
			  </p>

				No. The fundamental model of RDF is independent of XML. <a href="#whrdf" shape="rect">RDF</a> is a
				model describing qualified (or named) relationships between two (Web) resources, or
				between a Web resource and a literal. At that fundamental level, the only commonality
				between RDF and the XML World is the usage of the XML Schema datatypes to characterize
				literals in RDF. In fact, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-primer/" shape="rect">GRDDL</a>, a way to automate 
				mappings from XML to RDF easily, many XML vocabularies can be considered applications of RDF.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				Note that <em>one</em> of the serialization formats of RDF is indeed based on XML
				(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/" shape="rect">RDF/XML</a>), and this is probably
				the most widely used format today. But others exist, see the <a href="#serialization" shape="rect">separate question on RDF representation</a>.

				The Semantic Web standards follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/" shape="rect">design
				principles of the Web</a> in order to allow the growth of a planet-wide collection of
				semantically-rich data. The key element of this design is the use of Web addresses
				(URIs) to <em>name</em> things. Because the meaning of a term in a language without
				central control becomes established by its consistent use to achieve the same effect,
				and URIs are used around the World to access web pages, the Web is used to establish
				globally-shared meaning for URIs in the Semantic Web. (This is what people mean when
				they say RDF URIs are “grounded” in the Web.)
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				As with the Web in general, this approach allows the Semantic Web to grow and evolve
				without any central control or authority, but while still maintaining as much
				consistency and authorial control as needed for particular applications or particular
				enterprises. The techniques for doing all this are still evolving, but ideally whenever
				anyone sees a Semantic Web URI they can use it in their browser and see authoritative
				documentation about its use. Moreover, whenever some software encounters a URI in a
				Semantic Web context, it can dereference it and find an ontology which precisely
				specifies how the term is related to other terms. The software may thus learn and
				exploit new terms which are synonymous with terms it already knows, or related in more
				complex and useful (but logically precise) ways.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				All this results in the ability to find and correctly merge data from multiple sources,
				sometimes even when they are provided with different ontologies.

				SPARQL is a query language developed for the RDF data model; queries themselves
				<em>look and act</em> like RDF. I.e., the queries are independent of the physical
				representation of the RDF data (the structure of the databases, their representation in
				an RDF/XML file, etc). If query was done via, for example, XQuery, the application
				would have to know how that particular RDF data exactly represented as RDF/XML (and

				Ontologies define the concepts and relationships used to describe and represent an area
				of knowledge. Ontologies are used to classify the terms used in a particular
				application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible constraints on
				using those relationships. In practice, ontologies can be very complex (with several
				thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only).
			  </p>
			
            <p>
				An example for the role of ontologies or rules on the Semantic Web is to help data
				integration when, for example, ambiguities may exist on the terms used in the different
				data sets, or when a bit of extra knowledge may lead to the discovery of new
				relationships.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				A general example may help. A bookseller may want to integrate data coming from
				different publishers. The data can be imported into
				a common RDF model, eg, by using converters to the publishers’ databases. However,
				one database may use the term “author”, whereas the other may use the  term
				“creator”. To make the integration complete,
				and extra “glue” should be added to the RDF data, describing the fact that the
				relationship described as “author” is the same as “creator”. This extra piece 
				of information is, in fact, an ontology,
				albeit an extremely simple one.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>Languages like RDF Schemas and various variants of OWL provide languages

				The term “rules” in the context of

				example, constraints on the relationships defined by by RDF, or may be 
				used to discover new, implicit relationships. 
				</p>
				
            <p>
				Various rule systems (production rules, Prolog-like systems, etc) are

				systems. This core is based on restricted kind of rule, called a “Horn” 
				rule, which (like most rules) has the form “<strong>if</strong> 
				conditions <strong>then</strong> consequence”, but it places certain 
				restrictions on the kinds of conditions and consequences that can be 
				used. 
				</p>
				
            <p>
				A general example may help. While integrating data coming from different

				persons should be considered as identical, although this is clearly 
				important for a full integration. An extra condition can be expressed 
				stating that “if two persons have the same name, home page, and email 
				address, then they are identical”. Such condition can be expressed with

				like OWL).

				Broadly speaking, inference on the Semantic Web can be characterized by discovering new
				relationships. As <a href="#whrdf" shape="rect">described elsewhere in this FAQ</a>, the data is
				modeled as a set of (named) relationships between resources. “Inference” means that
				automatic procedures can generate new relationships based on the data and based on some
				additional information in the form of an ontology or a set of rules. Whether the new
				relationships are explicitly added to the set of data, or are returned at query time,
				is simply an implementation issue.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				A simple example may help. The data set to be considered may include the relationship
				<code>(Flipper isA Dolphin)</code>. An ontology may declare that “every
				<code>Dolphin</code> is also a <code>Mammal</code>”. That means that a Semantic Web
				program understanding the notion of “<code>X</code> is also <code>Y</code>” can add
				to the set of relationships the statement <code>(Flipper isA Mammal)</code>, although
				that was <em>not</em> part of the original data. One can also say that the new
				relationship was “discovered”.

				It depends on the application. <a href="#whinference" shape="rect">The answer on the role of
				ontologies and/or rules</a> includes a very simple ontology example. Some applications
				may decide not to use even such small ontologies, and rely on the logic of the
				application program. Some application may choose to use very simple ontologies like the
				one described, and let a general Semantic Web environment use that extra information to
				make the identification of the terms. Some applications need an agreement on common
				terminologies, without any rigor imposed by a logic system. Finally, some applications
				may need more complex ontologies with complex reasoning procedures. It all depends on
				the requirements and the goals of the applications.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				The current Semantic Web technologies offer a large palette of languages to describe
				simple or complex terminologies: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/" shape="rect">RDF
				Schemas</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-guide" shape="rect">SKOS</a>, or various
				dialects of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/" shape="rect">OWL</a> (OWL Lite, OWL DL, OWL
				Full). 
				These technologies differ in expressiveness but also in complexity. Applications have a choice 
				along a range from RDF Schema for representing the simplest ontology level, to OWL Full for 
				maximum expressiveness. In addition semantic web users are encouraged to
				leverage existing ontologies where possible: e.g., SKOS for
				representing basic structures like thesauri, taxonomies or other
				controlled  vocabularies. Good places to look for existing ontologies
				are detailed <a href="#findont" shape="rect">elsewhere in this FAQ</a>.
				They also have a choice of not to use any of those; the usage of
				ontologies is <em>not</em> a requirement for Semantic Web applications.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>

				No. What the Semantic Web technologies do is to define the “language” with well
				understood rules and internal semantics, ie, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/" shape="rect">RDF Schemas</a>, various dialects of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/" shape="rect">OWL</a>, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-guide" shape="rect">SKOS</a>. Which of those formalisms are
				used (if any) and what is “expressed” in those language is entirely up to the
				applications. Ontologies may be developed by small communities, from “below”, so to
				say, and shared with other communities.

				Obviously, that would not be feasible. If ontologies are used, they can come from
				anywhere and be mixed freely. In fact the “ethos” of the Semantic Web is to
				<em>share</em> and <em>reuse</em> as much as possible, and lot of work is done to
				semi-automatically bridge different vocabularies. Typical Semantic Web applications mix
				ontologies developed by different communities on the Web, like the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/" shape="rect">Dublin Core metadata</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" shape="rect">FOAF</a> (friend-of-a-friend) terms, etc.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				The Semantic Web’s attitude to ontologies is no more than a rationalization of actual
				data-sharing practice. Applications can and do interact without achieving or attempting
				to achieve global consistency and coverage. A system that presents a retailer’s wares
				to customers will harvest information from suppliers’ databases (themselves likely to
				use heterogeneous formats) and map it onto the retailer’s preferred data format for
				re-presentation. Automatic tax return software takes bank data, in the bank’s
				preferred format, and maps them onto the tax form. There is no requirement for global
				ontologies here. There isn’t even a requirement for agreement or global translations
				between the specific ontologies being used except in the subset of terms relevant for
				the particular transaction. Agreement need only be local, but adoption of vocabularies
				from existing ontologies facilitates data sharing and integration. Of course, some of the vocabularies
				may become more and more widely used and adopted, but the evolution is more bottom-up, rather than top-down.

            <p>The issue, referred to by this question, is that different people will not agree on exactly how 
			  to define all concepts.  Eg, while most  people have a fairly standard concept of a “dog” or a “cat”, not 
			  everyone can distinguish between a “scalar” and a “vector”, for instance.  Any computer application  
			  which tries to standardize its ontology will necessarily distort what at least some people are really 
			  trying to express; as a consequence, there will be ontological mismatches across parts of the Web designed by different people.
			  The issue is whether this may not ruin the very goals of the Semantic Web.</p>
			  
			  
            <p>However, the Semantic Web does <em>not</em> rely on having one, big, all-encompassing ontology. Instead, 
			  the Semantic Web is built up from small like-minded communities that can find agreement on terms amongst 
			  themselves. Applications, then, can and do interact without attempting to achieve global consensus.
			  There is no requirement for global ontologies: instead, an application need 
			  only map the terms relevant for a particular transaction into a common vocabulary. Of course, though 
			  agreement need only be local, adoption of existing vocabularies facilitates data sharing and integration.
			  </p>
			  
			  
            <p>Note that this issue is, essentially, the same as the one asking whether the Semantic Web requires 
			  everybody to subscribe to a single, predefined, giant ontology; see also the <a href="#whtopont" shape="rect">answer to that question</a>,

				The real difficulty, when developing an ontology, is to <em>understand</em> the problem
				that has to be modeled and <em>find an agreement</em> on a community level. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/" shape="rect">RDF Schemas</a> and/or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/" shape="rect">OWL</a> provide a framework to formalize those
				ontologies in a specific language; the time and energy needed to learn and use them is
				only a fraction of the time needed to develop an ontology itself, ie, understand the
				terms and the relationships of given area of knowledge and agree with your peers.
				Ontology development tools, like Protégé or SWOOP, hide most of the syntax complexity
				and let the user concentrate on the real representation issues.

            <p>The problem referred to by this question is the fact that, in formal logic, if there 
			  is an inconsitency somewhere, then it is possible to draw <em>all</em> conclusions <em>and</em> their
			  negations. The issue is whether this would not create major difficulties on the Semantic Web.</p>
			  
			  
            <p>“Inference” in terms of the Semantic Web can be characterized by discovering 
			  new relationships (as explained <a href="#whinference" shape="rect">in the answer of another question</a>). These inferences are mostly done within a restricted, “guarded” subset of first order logic. Usually, reasoning on the Semantic Web does not use the full power of first order (or higher order) logic, and therefore avoids some of the dangerous issues that can come from an inferred inconsistency. In other words, in practice, no major difficulties can be expected.</p>

				In general, ontologies should be created and maintained by various, specialized
				communities. The preference of W3C is to let these other communities develop their own
				ontologies; this is the case for well known ontologies like the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/" shape="rect">Dublin Core</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" shape="rect">FOAF</a>, <a href="http://usefulinc.com/doap" shape="rect">DOAP</a>,
				etc.
			  </p>
			  
            <p>
				There are cases, however, when ontologies are developed at W3C. This is the case when,
				for example, another W3C technology needs its own, specialized ontology (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/" shape="rect">EARL</a> is a good example), when W3C feels that
				the existence of a particular ontology is crucial for the advancement of the Semantic
				Web, or when the community prefers to use, for example, the facilities offered by the
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/" shape="rect">Incubator Activity of W3C</a>.
